# User Management System

## Overview

This Python script implements a simple user management system that allows users to register, log in, transfer amounts between users, update their data, and withdraw funds. The system stores user data in a text file (`userlist.txt`) and ensures data integrity by managing duplicates and updating user information correctly.

- **User Login**: Login using a username and passcode.
- **Transfer Amount**: Transfer funds between users using the recipient's username.
- **Update User Data**: Update user's name and passcode.
- **Withdraw Funds**: Withdraw funds from the user's account.

## Installation

To run this script, you need Python 3.x installed on your machine.
